# ⚡ Arduino-Chaos

Welcome to **Arduino-Chaos**, my chaotic journey through everything Arduino — from blinking LEDs to robots that may or may not develop self-awareness 😎💀  

This repo is a growing collection of Arduino experiments, each project pushing my understanding (and sometimes the limits of my sanity) one circuit at a time.  

---

## 🧠 What This Repo Is About
- Learning the fundamentals of **electronics and embedded programming**.
- Building cool (and occasionally useless) Arduino projects.
- Sharing code that actually works — so you don’t fry your Uno trying to blink an LED.  
- Each folder = one project, complete with code, notes, and circuit diagrams.

---

## 🧩 Projects
| 1 | Blinky | The first taste of chaos — a simple LED blink test | [View Code](https://github.com/Barlion/Arduino-chaos/tree/main/%231-Blinking-LED) |


> 💡 *Each project includes:*
> - `.ino` sketch  
> - Circuit diagram / breadboard layout  
> - Components list  
> - Short demo clip (eventually for TikTok 👀)

## ⚙️ Tools & Setup
- **Arduino IDE** or **VS Code + Arduino extension**
- **Git** for version control  
- **CapCut (Windows)** for editing the project videos  
- **GitHub** for code hosting & chaos containment
